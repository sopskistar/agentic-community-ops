Covers: (1) Onchain OS onboarding + welcome banner — 'what is onchainos', 'what is onchain os', 'what can it do', 'what can onchainos do', 'what does onchainos do', 'how do I use this', 'how do I play', 'how to use onchainos', 'how to play onchainos', 'how does onchainos work', 'how do I start', 'getting started', 'tutorial', 'onboarding', 'first time', 'I just installed', 'now what', 'what do I do now', 'where do I start', 'who are you', 'what are you', 'introduce onchainos', 'tell me about onchainos', 'I'm new'; (2) OKX.AI intro & role-registration routing (the Agent economic system — roles User / ASP / Evaluator) — 'what is OKX.AI', 'OKX.AI 是什么', 'how to use OKX.AI', 'OKX.AI 快速开始', and any spelling / spacing / casing / typo variant (OKXAI, okx ai, okx-ai, lowercase okx.ai, 啥是okxai); (3) customer support / Help Center — 'contact support', 'talk to a human', 'customer service', 'file a complaint', 'give feedback', 'report a bug / system error', 'help center', 'FAQ', 'user guide', 'something is broken'. NOT for: direct on-chain actions (swap / wallet / balance / token) or Agent task lifecycle (publish / accept / deliver / dispute) — those have their own skills."

# Onchain OS — Guide Hub (Onboarding · OKX.AI · Support)

The single entry point for onboarding, OKX.AI onboarding, and customer-support intents. Classify the user's intent, load the matching reference file, and follow it to completion. Each reference file is self-contained (it carries its own flow steps and acceptance criteria).

## Pre-flight Checks

**MUST**: Run the shared preflight **only for the onboarding flow** (§1 → `references/how-to-play.md`): read `../okx-agentic-wallet/_shared/preflight.md`; if that file does not exist, read `_shared/preflight.md` instead.

- **OKX.AI** (§2 → `references/ai-guide.md`): do **NOT** run the shared preflight here. `ai-guide.md` does its own login/identity check via `onchainos wallet status`, and the registration playbooks run their own preflight. (This matches the pre-merge standalone behavior and avoids an extra CLI round-trip.)
- **Support** (§3 → `references/ai-support.md`): conversation-layer only (no CLI) — no preflight.

## Intent Routing

Match the user's intent to a row, then read the Reference file(s) **before** responding and follow them exactly.

| User Intent | Reference |
|---|---|
| First-time / "what is onchainos" / "what can it do" / how to use / how to play / getting started / tutorial / "I just installed" / "now what" / "where do I start" / "I'm new" / welcome banner + numbered-pick routing | [`references/how-to-play.md`](./references/how-to-play.md) |
| OKX.AI — "what is OKX.AI" / "how to use OKX.AI" / "OKX.AI quick start" (any spelling variant) / register a role (User / ASP / Evaluator) / platform detection / registered-user home | [`references/ai-guide.md`](./references/ai-guide.md) |
| Customer support / talk to a human / customer service / file a complaint / give feedback / report a bug or system error / Help Center / FAQ / user guide / "something is broken" | [`references/ai-support.md`](./references/ai-support.md) |

## Disambiguation

**MUST**: When an opener could match more than one row, prefer the more specific intent:

- The subject is explicitly **OKX.AI** (any spelling / spacing / casing / typo variant) → **ai-guide.md**, even when phrased as onboarding ("how do I play OKX.AI").
- Generic **Onchain OS** onboarding, or a blank "now what / where do I start / I'm new" with no product named → **how-to-play.md**.
- Intent to reach a **human / complaint / feedback / bug / FAQ / help docs** → **ai-support.md**.
